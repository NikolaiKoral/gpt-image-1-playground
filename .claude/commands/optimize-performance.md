   - Suggest React.memo usage
   - Optimize context providers
   - Review hook dependencies

2. **Bundle Size Analysis**
   - Analyze chunk sizes
   - Identify large dependencies
   - Suggest code splitting opportunities
   - Review dynamic imports
   - Optimize image imports

3. **API Performance**
   - Measure endpoint response times
   - Identify N+1 queries
   - Suggest caching strategies
   - Optimize database queries
   - Review middleware overhead

4. **Image Optimization**
   - Validate Next.js Image usage
   - Check lazy loading implementation
   - Review format selection
   - Optimize thumbnail generation
   - Implement progressive loading

5. **Memory Usage**
   - Profile heap snapshots
   - Identify memory hotspots
   - Optimize data structures
   - Review garbage collection
   - Monitor long-running operations

TOOLS: Read, Grep, Task, Bash
