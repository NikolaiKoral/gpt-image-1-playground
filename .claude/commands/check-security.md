CRITICAL SECURITY AREAS TO CHECK:

1. **API Key Management**
   - Scan for hardcoded API keys in code
   - Verify environment variables are properly used
   - Check .env.example doesn't contain real keys
   - Ensure API keys aren't exposed in client-side code

2. **Authentication & Authorization**
   - Validate APP_PASSWORD SHA-256 implementation
   - Check middleware authentication flow
   - Verify password hashing is done server-side only
   - Ensure no auth bypass vulnerabilities

3. **Input Validation & Sanitization**
   - Check all file upload endpoints for:
     * File type validation
     * File size limits
     * Path traversal prevention
     * Malicious filename handling
   - Validate prompt inputs for injection attacks
   - Check image processing for buffer overflow risks

4. **CORS & API Security**
   - Review CORS configuration in middleware
   - Check for open redirects
   - Validate rate limiting implementation
   - Ensure proper error messages (no stack traces)

5. **Data Storage Security**
   - Verify IndexedDB data isn't sensitive
   - Check filesystem permissions for uploaded files
   - Ensure temporary files are cleaned up
   - Validate session management

6. **AI-Specific Security**
   - Check for prompt injection vulnerabilities
   - Validate Gemini/OpenAI response handling
   - Ensure no PII in AI prompts
   - Monitor for model manipulation attempts

7. **Dependency Security**
   - Check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
   - Verify Sharp, Archiver security configurations
   - Review third-party integrations

TOOLS: Read, Grep, Task
OUTPUT: Security report with severity levels (Critical, High, Medium, Low)

Execute a comprehensive security audit by:
1. Scanning all API routes for authentication checks
2. Reviewing file upload handling for security vulnerabilities
3. Checking for exposed secrets or API keys
4. Validating input sanitization across all endpoints
5. Reviewing AI prompt handling for injection risks
